7. Bounce a submission back to the coordinator
        1. for clarification with the submitter (which requires a comment saying why)
        2. because it can't be anonymised

As the judge I would like to
----------------------------
The judge is the person who sets the auto-acceptance thresholds for accepting talks in each round. They have no control over individual talk acceptance and simply set the threshold for a closed round.

1. See
        1. a sorted list of accepted submissions of each type for this round, with score and category
        2. the threshold for this type from previous rounds (if any)
        3. submissions with the same score grouped together into a single selectable group
        4. the un-anonymised submission
        5. the submission authors name and details
        6. all the submissions by a given author
        7. the review scores for a submission
        8. any comments by the reviewers
        9. any discussion with the submission author
        10. a visual representation of the review scores
        11. the category
        12. which submissions are new
        13. the distribution of categories and scores that have been previously accepted
2. Set an acceptance threshold for a type for this round
        1. which is limited to 30% of total slots in round 1 & 2
        2. which is limited to all remaining slots in round 3
        3. and I do not have to use all slots (the coordinator may accept more talks later)
3. Know how many slots (of a type) remain to be filled
        1. in this round
        2. in total
4. Know that on setting the threshold
        1. all accepted submissions above the threshold will get an email telling them they have been accepted
        2. all new unaccepted submissions will get an email telling them they've been put on the waitlist
        3. old unaccepted submissions from previous rounds will go into the next round

As coordinator I would like to
------------------------------
0. Set the number of available slots for each type of submission (e.g. talk, workshop, installation etc.)
1. Set the number of available slots for each category of submission (e.g. science, tech, feminism etc.)
1. Open the CFP
2. Close the CFP
        1. and notify all remaining un-accepted submissions that they have been rejected
3. Start a new round of selections and specify when it will end
        1. and know that all rejected talks will be emailed when it ends
        2. and know that all accepted talks will be judged and then emailed
4. Add users by email address such as
        1. reviewers
        2. anonymisers
        3. judges
5. Create categories for submissions
6. Add reviewers to categories
7. See
        1. all submissions
        2. submissions that have not been sent to anonymisation or rejected (that I need to work on)
        3. submissions that have been bounced back from anonymisation or review (that I need to communicate with the submitter about)
        4. submissions that have passed review but were not over the threshold (and go into another round)
        5. notes on submissions left by reviewers or anonymisers (so I can communicate with the submitter)
        6. why a submission was bounced back to me (because it can't be anonymised or needs more information)
        7. see the number of submissions in each category (so we can encourage more talks/speakers)
        8. see demographic breakdowns (submitted voluntarily)
8. Number of slots of a type that have been filled and are left to fill
9. Send a submission for anonymisation
10. Reject a submission and notify the submitter (because it's milo)
        1. when the round closes (default)
        2. immediately
11. Send a message to the submitter and see all
        1. previous messages sent to the submitter
        2. replies from the submitter
12. Be notified when submissions are cancelled by the submitter


FOR NEXT TIME:
We need to document how the rounds will work
We need to split out scheduling etc from this
We need to mark the required features VS the optional ones
We need to DRINK HEAVILY

WAITLIST IS A BAD TERM, maybe reserve list?
Graph when talks were submitted last year
We had 184 slots last year
When we finally reject all the talks before the event, tell all the speakers to talk to villages who have said they'll host talks
Sam thinks 6 rounds is better because 6 is bigger than 3 (also maybe one per month)

Notes
-----
* State diagrams in dot pls
* Submissions should be versioned and shown in a queue of edits to admins (speaker ops)
* find the paper about star ratings and doing them well
* talk to drmaciver about fairly selecting %'s from the rounds
