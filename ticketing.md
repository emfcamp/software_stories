* Use my ticket on site to redeem the items I have attached to my email address

As someone who has been transferred an item I
--------------------------------
* Must agree with the Terms and Conditions in order to accept the item
* Know that I have sole control over the item
* Can also transfer the item


As someone selling tickets I can
--------------------------------
* Create items
 * with a set sale price
 * in categories (entry tickets, items to rent, village things, etc)
 * optionally limited by amount available or time
 * optionally "redeemable" once (such as for a wristband, badge, 16a)
 * optionally marked as non-trasferrable (eg. setup/teardown tickets)
 * optionally marked as visible on the site
 * optionally marked as only visible/available with a specific voucher
 * optionally marked as purchasable
* Attach further sub-items to a ticket/item type (such as badges) that you also get when you buy the parent item (eg. kids do not get badges)

* Manually add a payment for a specific account/item and log information about how it was paid (bitcoin, cash, hugs)
* Attach additional information text to an item for the people redeeming it (This person is a speaker/journalist, call XYZ. This person needs to be given a shrew)
* Be able to "sell"/assign items to an email address with no action from the person (tickets for journalists etc)
* Generate a list of email addresses for
 * all attendees
 * just attendees with a specific item purchased
* Have a reliable analogue fallback

As someone who is checking people's tickets
-------------------------------------------
* I should be able to quickly authenticate an attendee and redeem an item by
 * registered email address + name
 * printed ticket
 * ticket on a phone screen/tablet
* I want to know if this person is a speaker/journalist/troll and if I have to give them any other information or paperwork/things


# Other things that are not user stories

Notes for people redeeming things
---------------------------------
* I want to know what to do when a ticket is marked as already in attendance
* I want to know what to do if someone turns up trying to pay with cash for a ticket that was pre-agreed to be paid in cash
* I want to know what to do if someone turns up without a ticket
* I want to be able to check in people for set-up and tear-down and issue them a magic wristband
* I want to know what to do if I don't know what to do
* I should know how to deal with questions people have

Questions that we have
----------------------
* How long does someone have a statuatory right to a cancellation or refund
 * A: They don't. You have no rights for ticket cancellation.
* How should we deal with people trying to use tickets that are already redeemed for a thing by mistake?

Things sam wants to remember
----------------------------
* Volunteering needs to share authentication
* Volunteering tent has streams from talks in there
