# Call for Participation review process

1. Submission is received
2. Submission is checked for basic suitability (i.e. submissions that violate the CoC are rejected)
3. Submission is assigned to a review-category
4. Submission is anonymised (if it cannot be anonymised it is returned to the submitter for corrections)
5. The anonymised submission is passed to the reviewers for that category. Reviewers rate submissions according to the following rubric:
    - 0 The reviewer does not believe the submission should be accepted
    - 1 The reviewer believe the submission should be accepted
    - 2 The reviewer strongly believes the submission should be accepted
6. At the end of the round:
    1. All of the submissions for that round are ordered based on their score (the ordering is calculated using the Majority Vote system)
    2. The highest scoring submissions (up to the maximum number of slots for that round) are accepted
    3. Submissions that aren't accepted are added to the next round (assuming the next round will finish before the submission's notification cut-off).
        - The first time that a submission is not accepted the submitter will be notified
        - In subsequent rounds the submitter will only be notified if their submission is accepted
        - The submitter can remove their submission from the process at any time

The maximum number of slots available in a round should be such that in all bar the final round only the very best talks are accepted and, ideally, no talks are accepted that would be rejected in later rounds.

Based on the analysis of a basic model it looks that at least 10 reviewers are needed and using 3 ratings should give sufficient granularity.

If there are 3 rounds then initially accepting <20% of all submissions seems to give a high chance of only accepting submissions that would be accepted regardless.
