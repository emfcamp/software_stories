# User Submitted Interstitials

## Problem

We have a large number of attendees who produce various forms of 2d art (video/paintings etc. etc.) as well events/groups/villages and other announcements (here-on "submissions").

It would be nice if, in addition to now & next information, we could display some of this on the screens between talks ("interstitials").

## Things to solve

Currently the interstitials are generated via infobeamer and is managed by the VOC. Any solution will need to integrate with this.

Submissions should not provide an avenue for trolling (either by them being vetted before display or requiring a user identity etc).

## Nice to have/extensions

Ideally submissions should be managable by their submitter. E.g. removed or edited (although this should trigger another vetting).

Ideally submissions should be archived/made available on the website/wiki.

Ideally now/next (+other info cf. [this issue](https://github.com/emfcamp/Website/issues/793)) should be displayable along side the submission (either via inset/overlay/ticket etc).

Ideally this should be as automated as possible (other than vetting if that's implemented).

The ability to expire/modify content/scripting (e.g. enable the submission of an advert for a film showing that evening which won't be shown the next day or dynamic content)
